Spring Boot Docker Primer

This project implements docker.

Container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software
that includes everything needed to run it.
	1) Code
	2) Runtime
	3) System Tools
	4) System Libraries
	5) Settings
	
Containers can be used across OS.

Containers isolate software from its surroundings.


Traditional VMs had a Hypervisor and Guest OS installations for each VM.

This has been eliminated with just a Docker engine running and containers running
on top of the engine. The engine acts as an abstraction between the container and Host OS and hardware.

We can also use Docker inside a VM.

Docker is an implementation of container platform.
